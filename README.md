## Portfolio Backend Repository

This repository contains the backend code for my personal portfolio website. The backend handles data storage, processing, and serving APIs for the frontend to interact with.

### Features:
- **API Endpoints:** Provides various endpoints for fetching user details, skills, projects, experience, education, and handling contact form submissions.
- **Database Integration:** Utilizes MySQL database for storing user data, project details, and contact form inquiries.
- **Secure Data Handling:** Implements prepared statements and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- **Error Handling:** Includes error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle exceptions and provide meaningful error messages.

### Technologies Used:
- **PHP:** Used for server-side scripting and creating API endpoints. 
- **MySQL:** Database management system for storing and retrieving data.
- **RESTful APIs:** Follows REST architecture principles for designing and implementing APIs.
- **GitHub Actions:** Utilized for continuous integration and automated testing.

### Usage:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the database schema and configure database connection parameters.
3. Customize API endpoints and logic according to your requirements.
4. Test the API endpoints locally or deploy them to a server.
